# How to setup
Requirements: ```NodeJS / NPM```

Download the source, and run ```npm install``` in the folder location.

Create an .env file based off of the example.env file, this is where you will put in your bot token and client id from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). (As of now, DEV_GUILD_ID doesn't do anything)

From here, you should be able to just run ```index.js``` and the bot should boot up.

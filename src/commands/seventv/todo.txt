Work on uploading individual emotes through their id
- Check if emote already exists


Work on importing emote sets
- Check if emotes > remaining emote slots left in server. If so, warn and ask if they'd like to continue, even if all emotes aren't imported.
- Actually figure out uploading emotes
- What to do about emotes that are significantly larger than 1:1 aspect ratio (Not including like 1.000275, but rather 1.5)
- Ask if they'd like to upload overlay emotes as well.

Possibly add cooldowns on the commands.
